.env
```
REACT_APP_SERVER_DOMAIN='<server_domain>' # example 'http://localhost:8080'
```


After that create a file in the Server Folder with the name config.js and put the below code inside it.

config.js
```
export default {
    JWT_SECRET : "<secret>",
    EMAIL: "steve.franecki@ethereal.email", // testing email & password
    PASSWORD : "sMf46xCzrvdrxvuagc",
    ATLAS_URI: "<MONGODB_ATLAS_URI>"
}
```

> **Note:** The **ATLAS_URI** is important to work this project.

Now, create all these variables in the project and make sure you set ATLAS_URI variable.
Otherwise, the project will not work.
